## Set Up

Clone repository, install dependencies, and run docs site and Playroom.

```bash
gh repo clone mirror-xyz/degen
yarn
yarn dev
```

## Adding Components

Scaffold a new component:

```bash
yarn gen:component
```

Export from `src/index.ts` to make available:

```ts
export { ComponentName } from './components'
```

## Adding Icons

Add a `.svg` file to `icons` and run:

```bash
yarn gen:icons
```

All files in the `icons` directory are automatically converted to React components and exported for use. Generated icons should follow a 24x24 bounding box.

## Publishing New Versions

[Create a new release](https://github.com/mirror-xyz/degen/releases/new) on GitHub with a tag that follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). Publishing a release triggers a workflow for building, testing, and pushing to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/degen).
